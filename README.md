# Find a Flick

This is a fully functional and responsive web application to find movies, series and related information!

It was made with a mobile first approach and uses the APIs from The Movie Database(for the informations on movies and series), Youtube (for the movies' and series' trailers) and Spotify (for soundtrack or "inspired by" playlists).

You can see it here:
